      <h1>My Schedule</h1>
      <p>A wise man once said &quot;Get organized. All the cool kids are doing it.&quot; 
      We at Nawwar are not sure that all the kids are doing it, but we are sure 
      that getting organized and planning ahead is key to success. And thats 
      why, dear students, we created you a schedule where you can know your 
      weekly plan. Way to go little learners!</p>
      <h2>My progress</h2>
      <p>Hannah Montanna once said that &quot;Practice makes you perfect&quot; We at 
      Nawwar believe that practice makes progress, not perfect. We also believe 
      that a little progress each day adds to bigger results. That is why, 
      little learners, we created you a way to track your progress. By visitny 
      the &quot;Progress&quot; tab, you will be able to see your assignments as well as 
      your progress. </p>
